# Total Variation Profile

This repository contains a model Matlab implementation of the "total variation profile" model proposed in:

*[Total Variation Isoperimetric Profiles](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.07943)  
Daryl DeFord, Hugo Lavenant, Zachary Schutzman, Justin Solomon*

Our repository includes multiple optimization algorithms, including a model CVX implementation, projected gradient descent, and ADMM.  See `test2DTVProfile.m` for an example of how to run the code.
